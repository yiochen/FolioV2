    p  is a dialog with Material Design styling and optional animations when it is opened or closed. It provides styles for a header, content area, and an action area for buttons. You can use the <paper-dialog-scrollable> element (in its own repository) if you need a scrolling content area. See Polymer.PaperDialogBehavior for specifics.
